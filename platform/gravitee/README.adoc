# Gravitee IO Test Certificate

The following commands are needed to include the self-signed gravitee.io certificate to the java truststore (cacerts).

Note that this self-signed certificate *should not be used in production* and has been generated for testing only.

First, get a copy of the jre `cacerts` and place it on the `gravitee` folder.
Note : you can get a copy of the `cacerts` file from a running jr8 image at this location: `/etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts`.

Next, import the certificate into the truststore by running this command:
```
keytool -import -noprompt -trustcacerts -keystore cacerts -storepass changeit -alias gio-selfsigned -file ../traefik/certs/gio-selfsigned.crt
```

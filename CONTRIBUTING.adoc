== Using GitHub issues

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and enhancements. Found a bug in the source code? You want to propose new features or enhancements  You can help us by submitting an issue in our https://github.com/gravitee-io/gravitee-docker[repository]. Before you submit your issue, search the https://github.com/gravitee-io/issues/issues[issues repository]; maybe your question was already answered.

> Issues are only to report bugs, request enhancements, or request new features.

== Submitting changes

You've submitted an issue to the project and know how to fix it? You can contribute to the project by https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/[forking the repository] and https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request[submitting your pull requests].

Before you submit your pull request consider the following guidelines:

* Make your changes in a new git branch:

```shell
git checkout -b issue/#<issue-id>-my-fix-branch master
```
	Note : issue-id reference the id generated by GitHub (#issue-id).

* Create your patch, **including appropriate test cases**.
* Update the documentation if you create new features or think the documentation needs to be updated/completed.
* Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message.

```shell
 git commit -a
```

* Build your changes locally to **ensure all the tests pass**:

```shell
mvn clean install
```

* Push your branch to GitHub:

```shell
git push origin issue/#<issue-id>-my-fix-branch
```

* In GitHub, send a pull request to `<gravitee-io/gravitee-docker>:master`.

* If we suggest changes then:
  ** Make the required updates.
  ** Re-run the test suite to ensure tests are still passing.
  ** Commit your changes to your branch (e.g. `issue/<issue-id>-my-fix-branch`).
  ** Push the changes to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request).

If the PR gets too outdated we may ask you to rebase and force push to update the PR:

```shell
git rebase master
git push origin issue/#<issue-id>-my-fix-branch -f
```
